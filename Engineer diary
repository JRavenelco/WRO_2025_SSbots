This folder contains updates on the changes the team has made to the robot.
16/7/2025: Tried implementing two-speed automatic gearbox for more torque at first and then more speed,
then temporarily removed due to complications (might improve it and use it later).
Also worked on implementing wired ethernet connection to our workspace to guarantee a more stable internet connection.
