# Introduction

We are the SSBots team from Mexico, competitors in the WRO Future Engineers category. This is our first year competing in this category, exploring further into WRO after competing for years in the Robo Mission Category. The purpose of this repository is to document our efforts during the 2025 season.

## Past experiences

  **Our team has participated in WRO Robo Mission competitions for a few years,** as to explore further into new challenges like autonomous vehicles and artificial vision,  we could carry over developments from **RoboMission** . Some of the topics were:
  - Vehicle design and instrumentation, (embedding sensors and actuators while designing purpose built hardware for the specific task.
  - Coding experience, like making a framework, carrying over and porting Python and C code for the LEGO Mindstorms.
  - PID control, implementation and tuning.
  - Path planning, obstacle detection and avoidance. 

Even though we faced multiple difficulties with development and integration of new technologies onto our Robot, while exploring onto the use of electronics for hardware design and training our own AI model for real-time vision, object detection and labeling, and decision making, in addition to all the difficulties that are still to come, we have managed to overcome these difficulties and solve this challenges. We plan on innovating and improving even further before participating in Mexico´s national WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition.

# Engineering Materials

This repository holds the engineering materials developed for a self-driving vehicle with Ackerman drive train for the WRO Future Engineers competition for the 2025 season, documentation will be updated as development continues.   

# Content

* `t-photos` includes team photos during the weekly development workshops
* `v-photos` includes photos of the vehicle, for reference all sides are documented along with a 3D model rendering.
* `video` includes test videos of the vehicle in action and of the development process.
* `schemes` contains schematic diagrams of the electromechanical components, connection diagrams and list of components used in case any other team wants to take inspiration or reproduce the vehicle after the season.
* `src` contains the control software code for all components programmed for the competition.
* `models` contains 3D models of custom components developed, all can be fabricated by use of a 3D printer or laser cutter. As reference a Brick link Studio Model and the STL files for the Technic compatible elements is included.
* `other` contains additional reference files and documentation used for development.

## Teamwork

We usually met up once a week to work on this project, each taking on one part of the project to develop, even if we were not all available, we established targets and tasks to achieve for the current and next couple of weeks. We strived to have everyone involved on all areas of the project, with each dedicated onto the parts they were the most familiar or wanted to further explore and the rest supporting and keeping on the loop as to have the complete picture of the development process. Efforts were documented locally on the computers dedicated for each teams use and pushed onto **GitHub** when significant advances were made or a stable version was reached and frequent communication over the teams chat group. As each part needed to be integrated onto the robot, all our efforts needed to be integrated as a team.  
  
# Conclusion
Looking back on this project, **it’s crazy to see how much we’ve learned.** We started off feeling a little lost, but as we worked through the challenges, we gained a better understanding of how to use these new technologies and integrating them together. We definitely faced some tough moments, but pushing through those helped us grow as a team and as individuals. Even though there’s still a lot more to learn, we’re proud of what we accomplished and excited to take what we’ve learned into future projects.
