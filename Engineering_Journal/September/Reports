September 1st: We started using the LiDAR to keep the robot aligned and to perform turns at the right time. However, we discovered that something was causing the LiDAR to malfunction.
September 2nd: After running more tests to determine whether the issue was with the LiDAR itself, the code, or the robotâ€™s structure, we discovered that the wheels were obstructing its view, preventing the LiDAR from returning accurate measurements.
September 4th: We redesigned most of the robot to make it almost fully 3D-printed, while simultaneously fixing the issue with the LiDAR and improving the robot's structure and steering mechanism.
